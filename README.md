# Algorithms Exercises

This is a collection of exercises from the excellent UCSD/Moscow HSE "Algorithmic Toolbox" course.

This course covers dozens of algorithmic exercises covering topics such as:

- Greedy Algorithms
- Divide and Conquer
- Dynamic Programming
- + other random exercises

The instructors are excellent and the amount of problems helpful in developing a strong foundation.
I would highly recommend this course to anybody looking for a refresher on thinking about and developing algorithms.
