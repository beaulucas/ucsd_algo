# Algorithms Exercises

This is a collection of exercises from the excellent UCSD/Moscow HSE "Algorithmic Toolbox" course.

This course covers dozens of algorithmic exercises covering topics such as:

- Greedy Algorithms
- Divide and Conquer
- Dynamic Programming
- other random exercises

Overall, this course had strong lecturers and an abundance of practice problems that solidify the learning material. The auto-grader was also limited in providing hints around failure, which makes the programmer think harder about edge cases and overall design.
